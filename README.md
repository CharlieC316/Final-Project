The game is called BlockStack.

The goal of the game is to get the tower as high as possible within the time limit given to the player. IF the tower gets to high it crumbles and the player must start again getting more points.
Each block is a different color and shape so making sure the tower is stable also helps make the tower go up as well as the points.

The whole goal of the game is to do something on the side or to race friends who also might have the code.
getting thw tower as high as possible depends on how many points the player has, each player gets 10 points per the highest block stacked upwards.

This code requires pygame as well to help itself run correctly.
