Title:
    Stacking Blocks

Goal of the game:
    Will be a block stacking game. the higher the blocks go the higher the player's score. the goal is to get as high as possible. 
    It is relevent as a way to help entiertaine people. It is a form of digital media that people can itneract with

Features:
    I hope every time a block to be placed appears on screen it will be a different color or maybe even different shape to add challenge to the game.

Challegnes:
    I need to learn more about pygame and how it works.
    Will need to know how collsion physics work.

Outcomes:
    I want to be able to get the basic block stacking ability done.
    I want the blocks to change color and shape.
    I want to add size changing and different claws that will drop the blocks.
    
    Ideal:
        I want the gamwe to be functional and have different textures and maybe art to help import into to game to give it more life. I want it to function.
    Minimal:
        I want the game to work as inteded. Color, size and shape all change. I want the blocks to have a texture and collison.

Milesones:
    Basic collision in how blocks are stacked together.
    I want the blocks to change color at random and shape.
    Basic score count.
